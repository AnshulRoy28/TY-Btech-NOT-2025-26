# Numerical Optimization Techniques (B. Tech, Semester V)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Numerical Optimization Techniques** course (BTECH 303) offered by the uGDX School of Technology, ATLAS Skilltech University, Mumbai. This course is designed for 3rd-year undergraduate students and is rich in practical numerical programming.

## 🧠 Course Description

This course introduces students to mathematical foundations and computational techniques for solving optimization problems. Topics include:

- Linear & Nonlinear Programming
- Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization
- Duality, Sensitivity Analysis
- Gradient-Based Methods (GD, Newton-Raphson)
- Metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithms, PSO)

## 🎯 Course Objectives

- Formulate and classify different types of optimization problems
- Apply classical techniques (Simplex, Graphical)
- Explore modern methods (GA, PSO, Gradient Descent)
- Implement and understand each algorithm through code

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each week contains Python notebooks or code files related to the topic of study.

```
